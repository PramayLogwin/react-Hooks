=> Life cycle method:-
mounting,update,unmounting

1.component didmounting:-
The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
2.Unmounting :-
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

==> Hook :-

1.use state = use for component rerendering.
2.use effect = use for some perform side effects like data fecthing,use dependencies,settimeout
3.use context = use for calling data means we can also use props but props driling..
                using context hook we can directly sent data component a to d ,a to c and etc.
4.use ref = use for changing element styles.
5.use reducer = reducer and use state hook are same but use reducer hook allows custom logic.
6.use custom = this hook is memoarized hook .it's stop unnessery rendering.it's
               return memoarized function.
7.use Memo = use memo and custom hhok are similar but memo give a memoarized value.
               it's run only on dependencies update
